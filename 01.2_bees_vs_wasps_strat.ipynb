    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a detective investigating a scene.  A feature map is like a sketch you create, focusing on specific details that might be clues to solving the case.  In a CNN, the \"case\" is recognizing patterns in an image, and the feature maps capture these patterns at different levels of complexity. Early layers might create feature maps that detect basic edges, corners, or blobs of color. As the network progresses through more layers, the feature maps become more intricate, combining these simpler features to represent more complex objects or shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting a bit more technical, a feature map is a 2D array of activations produced by applying a convolutional filter to an input image or a previous layer's feature map. It essentially captures the presence and strength of specific visual features the filter is optimized to detect within the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **convolutional filters** (also just called \"filters\" or \"kernels\") are small matrices containing learnable weights. The filter \"slides\" across the input image, performing element-wise multiplication with the underlying image data at each position. The result of the multiplication is then passed through an activation function (like ReLU) to introduce non-linearity and help the network learn complex features. A convolutional layer typically has multiple filters, each generating a separate feature map. These feature maps capture different aspects of the input, providing a richer representation of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: The above sunflower example could potentially be a bit misleading. While a model *can* and probably will develop a vertical edge detection filter, the model develops it's filter's weights through the same backpropagation process as other deep neural networks. Most of the filters, and their resulting feature maps, will not be as easily interpretable as the vertical edge detection filter."

Here is an example of a convulutional layer with a stride of 2 and padding of `'same'`:\n",
